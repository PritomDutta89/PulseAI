1. In Node js once you run the server, from that time its connected with DB until you stop the server
But
In Next.js its work differently, next js not running the server all time, its connect with server only when,
demand is created. means when req send frontend side that time only created, after that it closed it again. 
means for every req it connected with server again and again
so problem is if you send 1 req and in middle you continuously send another req, then it will cause issue [performance issue],
bcz it connected with 2 times, and throw err.
Solution - so we check if connection is present then dont connect, if not then connect it
